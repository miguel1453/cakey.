This is the beginning of an app that I can hopefully implement into my family business, Los Portales Supermarket of Wilmington, NC. 

This app allows users (employees) to take customer cake orders. All orders are ordered by date for better management.

In the future, I plan to implement a way to delete old orders, group orders by date, and provide a page that displays important data for bakers (how 
many cakes and of what size for today, what fillings should we buy more of, etc.) A way of keeping track if the cake was paid or not would also be helpful.
